## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AshwinKumar-V/RecipePage/main/.github/images/Screenshot.jpg)

Hey there devs! This was my fourth project at devChallenges.io to build a responsive website. This page has a cake recipe and instructions with little checkboxes to click on if you have the ingredients.
You can checkout my demo [here](https://ashwinkumar-v.github.io/RecipePage).

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- HTML5
- CSS3

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/paths/responsive-web-developer) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/OEKdUZ6xs0h99C38XVht) was to build an application to complete the following user stories:

- I can see a recipe with ingredients and instructions
- I can select a checkbox if I have the ingredients
- I can see the number of servings, baking times
